A one company deploy a sensor in their machines due to find out the causes of unfortunate breakdown. Behalf of that we did a MAchine Learning projects and give insigths of enviromental effect, Heat exaust and many other things can lead the machine towards the  breakdown.

Sensor = Volatage Difference (dV = V1 - V2)

Now, Sensor placed neare the circuit bord and mechanism of rotor to measure the volatge. We first fix the volatge of sensor and then the heat or environment change inside and that is read by sensor and store in our databse. 
After Data aquisition we can make a csv file for further processing or hand over the Data analysis department. Using ML tactics and doing hard Exploratory Data anlaysis process they can get a good dataset. Wheere we can apply a Time series anlaysis process and finding Anomalies.

Anomalies : A unexceptional behaviour in the dataset, Even its normal or abnormal with respect to time. Where the many time voltage is high or some time negative. Diffrenceate with each other is easy but companset and throughout to caliber is difficult for system.

MAjor breakdown happen, When two environmental season is crossover or in extreame condition of heat. Mahine can not sustain in extream heat temprature in Summer due to its alrady an heated due to friction.
